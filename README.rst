Welcome to Eclim on GitHub
==========================

.. note::

   (Aug. 03, 2024)

   Eclim has reached its end of life. The Language Server Protocol (LSP) and
   the various implementations are mature enough that eclim has become
   unnecessary.

   It has been a great run (nearly 20yrs!) and I'm grateful for everyone that
   helped out, from bug reports to patches, it's been awesome.

.. _overview:
