If at any time you have any questions or feedback, feel free to post to one of
the eclim mailing lists:

  troubleshooting, etc.

IRC (#eclim on freenode.net)
----------------------------

If you would like to get help or ask questions on IRC, then feel free to join
#eclim on freenode.net. Please note that I (Eric Van Dewoestine, ervandew on
irc) try to stay in the channel as much as possible, but I might not be
available to answer questions immediately. It's also worth noting that I live
in California, so if you are in Europe, Asia, or some other timezone whose
normal waking hours don't overlap well with mine, then you may be better off
getting help using one of the mailing lists above.
