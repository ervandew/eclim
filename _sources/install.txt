Download / Install
==================

Requirements
============

Before beginning the installation, first confirm that you have met the
following requirements.

- `Java Development Kit`_ 1.8 or greater
- `Vim`_ 7.1 or greater
- `Eclipse eclipse_version`_
- python (2.7 or 3.x)
- make
- gcc

  **Minimum Vim Settings**: In order for eclim to function properly, there is a
  minimum set of vim options that must be enabled in your vimrc file (:h vimrc).

  - **set nocompatible**

    Execute :h 'compatible' for more info.  You can confirm that
    compatibliity is turned off by executing the following in vim:

    .. code-block:: vim

      :echo &compatible

    Which should output '0', but if not, then add the following to your ~/.vimrc
    files:

    .. code-block:: vim

      set nocompatible
  - **filetype plugin on**

    Execute :h filetype-plugin-on for more info.  You can confirm
    that file type plugins are enabled by executing the following:

    .. code-block:: vim

      :filetype

    Which should output 'filetype detection:ON  plugin:ON indent:ON', showing
    at least 'ON' for 'detection' and 'plugin', but if not, then update your
    ~/.vimrc to include:

    .. code-block:: vim

      filetype plugin indent on

Download
========

You can find the official eclim installer on eclim's github `releases page`_:

- :eclimdist:`bin`

.. _releases page: https://github.com/ervandew/eclim/releases/

Third Party Packages
--------------------

As an alternative to the official installer, there are also some packages
maintained by third parties:

- **Arch:** `aur (eclim) <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eclim/>`_,
  `aur (eclim-git) <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/eclim-git/>`_

Installing / Upgrading
======================

Eclim can be installed a few different ways depending on your preference and
environment:

- :ref:`Interactive Command Line Installer <installer>`
- :ref:`Unattended Command Line Installer <installer-automated>`
- :ref:`Build from source <install-source>`
- :ref:`Install on a headless server <install-headless>`

.. _installer:

Interactive Command Line Installer
----------------------------------

Step 1: Run the installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

  If you have eclipse running, please close it prior to starting the
  installation procedure.

- **First download the installer:**  :eclimdist:`bin`

- **Next run the installer:**

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin

  After the installer starts up, simply follow the steps to install eclim.

  If your machine is behind a proxy, take a look at the instructions for
  :ref:`running the installer behind a proxy <installer-proxy>`.

Step 2: Test the installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test eclim you first need to start the eclim daemon.  How you start the
daemon will depend on how you intend to use eclim.

.. note::

  More info on running the eclim daemon can be found in the :doc:`eclimd
  </eclimd>` docs.

If you plan on using eclim along with the eclipse gui, then simply start
eclipse and open the eclimd view:

:menuselection:`Window --> Show View --> Other --> Eclim --> eclimd`

By default the eclimd view will also be auto opened when you open a file using:

:menuselection:`Open With --> Vim`

If you plan on using eclim without the eclipse gui, then:

- start the eclimd server.

  To start eclimd, simply execute the eclimd script found in your eclipse root
  directory (or the path specified at the end of the command line installer):

  ::

    $ $ECLIPSE_HOME/eclimd

Once you have the eclim daemon (headed or headless) running, you can then test
eclim:

- open a vim window and issue the command, :ref:`:PingEclim`.  The result of
  executing this command should be the eclim and eclipse version echoed to the
  bottom of your Vim window.  If however, you receive ``unable to connect to
  eclimd - connect: Connection refused``, or something similar, then your
  eclimd server is not running or something is preventing eclim from connecting
  to it.  If you receive this or any other errors you can start by first
  examining the eclimd output to see if it gives any info as to what went
  wrong.  If at this point you are unsure how to proceed you can view the
  :ref:`troubleshooting guide <troubleshooting>` or feel free to post your
  issue on the `eclim-user`_ mailing list.

  Example of a successful ping:

  .. image:: images/screenshots/ping_success.png

  Example of a failed ping:

  .. image:: images/screenshots/ping_failed.png

- Regardless of the ping result, you can also verify your vim settings
  using the command **:EclimValidate**.  This will check
  various settings and options and report any problems. If all is ok
  you will receive the following message:

  ::

    Result: OK, required settings are valid.

.. _installer-proxy:

Running The Installer Behind a Proxy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are behind a proxy, you may need to run the installer like so (be sure
to take a look at the related :ref:`faq <eclim_proxy>` as well):

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin --proxy my.proxy:8080

If your proxy requires authentication, you'll need to supply the username and
password as well:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin --proxy myuser:mypass@my.proxy:8080

.. _installer-automated:

Unattended (automated) install
------------------------------

The eclim installer supports the ability to run an automated
install without prompting the user for any input, as long as you supply all the
necessary input it requires.

Simply run the installer as shown
below, supplying the location of your eclipse install, vim files location, and
the plugins you wish to install:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin \
    --yes \
    --eclipse=/opt/eclipse \
    --vimfiles=$HOME/.vim \
    --plugins=jdt,pydev

.. _install-source:

Building from source
--------------------

.. include:: /development/gettingstarted.rst
   :start-after: begin-build
   :end-before: end-build

.. _install-headless:

Installing on a headless server
-------------------------------

The eclim daemon supports running both inside of the eclipse gui and as a
"headless" non-gui server. However, even in the headless mode, eclipse still
requires a running X server to function. If you are running eclim on a desktop
then this isn't a problem, but some users would like to run the eclim daemon on
a truly headless server. To achieve this, you can make use of X.Org's Xvfb
server.

.. note::

  This guide uses the Ubuntu server distribution to illustrate the process of
  setting up a headless server, but you should be able to run Xvfb on the
  distro of your choice by translating the package names used here to your
  distro's equivalents.

The first step is to install the packages that are required to run eclipse and
eclim:

- Install a java jdk, xvfb, and the necessary build tools to compile eclim's
  nailgun client during installation (make, gcc, etc).

  ::

    $ sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk xvfb build-essential

Then you'll need to install eclipse. You may do so by installing it from your
distro's package manager or using a version found on `eclipse.org`_. If you
choose to install a version from you package manager, make sure that the
version to be installed is compatible with eclim since the package manager
version can often be out of date. If you choose to install an `eclipse.org`_
version, you can do so by first downloading eclipse using either a console
based browser like elinks, or you can navigate to the download page on your
desktop and copy the download url and use wget to download the eclipse archive.
Once downloaded, you can then extract the archive in the directory of your
choice.

.. note::

  When downloading an eclipse distribution, make sure you download one of their
  `archives <http://eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/>`_ vs the eclipse
  installer. An archive can simply be extracted to install eclipse, but the
  eclipse installer (their default download) may require a gui to install.

::

  $ wget <eclipse_mirror>/eclipse-<version>-linux-gtk.tar.gz
  $ tar -zxf eclipse-<version>-linux-gtk.tar.gz

Once eclipse is installed, you can then install eclim normally:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin

The last step is to start Xvfb followed by eclimd:

::

  $ Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
  $ DISPLAY=:1 ./eclipse/eclimd -b

When starting Xvfb you may receive some errors regarding font paths and
possibly dbus and hal, but as long as Xvfb continues to run, you should be
able to ignore these errors.

The first time you start eclimd you may want to omit the 'start' argument so
that you can see the output on the console to ensure that eclimd starts
correctly.

.. include:: /eclimd.rst
   :start-after: begin-eclimd-user
   :end-before: end-eclimd-user

Upgrading
---------

The upgrading procedure is the same as the installation procedure but please be
aware that the installer will remove the previous version of eclim prior to
installing the new one.  The installer will delete all the org.eclim* eclipse
plugins along with all the files eclim adds to your .vim or vimfiles directory
(plugin/eclim.vim, eclim/\*\*/\*).

.. _uninstall:

Uninstall
=========

To uninstall eclim you can use the eclim installer like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin uninstall

.. _uninstall-automated:

Unattended (automated) uninstall
--------------------------------

Like the installer, the uninstaller also supports an unattended uninstall. You
just need to supply your eclipse and vim files directories:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ ./eclim_eclim_release.bin
    --eclipse=/opt/eclipse \
    --vimfiles=$HOME/.vim \
    uninstall
