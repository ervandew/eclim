.. _1.7.13:

2.2.5 / 1.7.13 (Nov. 25, 2012)
------------------------------

Eclim:
  - 1.7.13 and above will now support Eclipse 3.8 as well as 3.7.
  - Fix :ref:`:ProjectGrep <:ProjectGrep>` and :ref:`:ProjectTodo
    <:ProjectTodo>` to search in all of the project's links as well.

------------------------------

Eclim:
  - Updated :ref:`:ProjectTree <:ProjectTree>` and :ref:`:ProjectTab
    <:ProjectTab>` to support an arbitrary directory as an argument, allowing
    you to use the command for project's not managed by eclipse/eclim. :TreeTab
    has been removed since the update to :ProjectTab makes it redundant.
  - Creation of projects in nested directories in the eclipse workspace (vs at
    the root of the workspace) is now properly supported through eclim.

Android:
  - Updated for ADT 21.0.0.

C/C++:

  - Fixes execution of eclim commands from vim on Windows when using the
    external nailgun client (vs the python client).

| :gitlog:`Git Log (2.2.3) <2.2.2...2.2.3>`
| :gitlog:`Git Log (1.7.11) <1.7.10...1.7.11>`

.. _2.2.2:
.. _1.7.10:

2.2.2 / 1.7.10 (Oct. 07, 2012)
------------------------------

Eclimd:
  - Updated eclimd script for Linux/OSX to supply reasonable defaults for heap
    and perm gen space if not already set by ~/.eclimrc.

C/C++:
  - Fixed C++ project creation to auto add the required C nature.
  - Fixed C/C++ issues introduced by the eclipse 4.2.1 release (project
    create/refresh and call hierarchy).

Java:
  - :JavaImportSort, :JavaImportClean, and :JavaImportMissing all removed in
    favor of a new command which performs the functionality of all three:
    :ref:`:JavaImportOrganize <:JavaImportOrganize>`
  - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportExclude has been replaced with the eclim
    setting :ref:`org.eclim.java.import.exclude <org.eclim.java.import.exclude>`.
  - The vim option g:EclimJavaImportPackageSeparationLevel has been replaced
    with the eclim setting :ref:`org.eclim.java.import.package_separation_level
    <org.eclim.java.import.package_separation_level>`.
  - g:EclimJavaBeanInsertIndexed vim variable removed in favor of suffixing
    :JavaGetSet methods with '!'.
  - :JavaCorrect, :JavaImpl, :JavaDelegate, :JavaConstructor, and :JUnitImpl
    all now perform their code manipulations using eclipse operations.
  - Initial support added for running :JavaSearch commands from source file
    results (library source files) not in a project.
  - g:EclimJavaCheckstyleOnSave replaced with the eclim setting
    :ref:`org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate
    <org.eclim.java.checkstyle.onvalidate>`.
  - g:EclimJavaSrcValidate renamed to g:EclimJavaValidate.
  - :JUnitExecute replaced with a new and improved :ref:`:JUnit <:JUnit>`
    command.
  - Added the command :ref:`:JUnitFindTest <:JUnitFindTest>` to open the
    corresponding test for the current file.
  - Removed :Javac command since eclipse's continuous incremental builds
    typically make the :Javac call a no op, and in cases where you need to
    induce compilation, :ref:`:ProjectBuild <:ProjectBuild>` does so in a
    language agnostic way.
  - Added :ref:`:JavaMove <:JavaMove>` command to move a java source file from
    one package to another.
  - Added :ref:`:JavaDocPreview <:JavaDocPreview>` to display the javadoc of
    the element under the cursor in vim's preview window.

----------------------

Bug Fixes:
  - Several minor bug fixes.

    (errors > warnings > etc.).

C/C++:
  - Fixed :CSearch results on Windows platforms.
  - Re-implemented c/c++ project creation.

    .. note::

      If you created any c or c++ projects via eclim (as opposed to creating
      the project via the eclipse project wizard), then you are strongly
      encouraged to recreate those projects using the following steps:

      1. Delete the project using ``:ProjectDelete project_name``
      2. Remove the .cproject file at the root of your project.
      3. Re-create the the project using
         ``:ProjectCreate /project/path/ -n c`` (or cpp)

      After that you will need to re-configure any src or include folders you
      may have added.

:gitlog:`Git Log (1.3.1) <1.3.0...1.3.1>`

.. _1.3.0:

1.3.0 (July 01, 2007)
---------------------

Bug Fixes:
  - Bug fixes.

Eclim:
  - New graphical installer for easing the installation and upgrading
    procedure.
  - In previous releases of eclim, any time a command required access to
    the eclipse representation of a source file, eclim would force a full
    refresh of the current project to ensure that any external additions,
    deletions, or changes to other files would be automatically detected.
    However, this approach, while convenient and transparent to the user,
    comes with a performance penalty that grows as the project size grows.

    For some users this performance penalty has been more noticeable than
    for others.  So in response to this feedback, eclim no longer performs
    an automatic project refresh.  What this means for you is that any time
    you perform an action that results in any file additions, deletions, or
    changes, like a svn / cvs update, you should issue a :ref:`:ProjectRefresh`
    to ensure that eclipse and eclim are updated with the latest version of the
    files on disk.
  - :ref:`:ProjectCreate` now supports optional -p argument for specifying the
    project name to use.
  - Created new command :ref:`:ProjectRefreshAll` to support refreshing all
    projects at once, and modified :ref:`:ProjectRefresh` to only refresh the
    current project if no project names are supplied.
  - Added
    :ref:`:ProjectGrep`,
    :ref:`:ProjectGrepAdd`,
    :ref:`:ProjectLGrep`, and
    :ref:`:ProjectLGrepAdd`.
  - Added support for buffer local variable
    **b:EclimLocationListFilter** which can contain a list of
    regular expression patterns used to filter location list entries with
    text / message field matching one of the patterns.  The main intention
    of this new variable is to allow you to filter out validation errors /
    warnings per file type, that you wish to ignore.

    Example which I have in my .vim/ftplugin/html/html.vim file\:

    .. code-block:: vim

      let b:EclimLocationListFilter = [
          \ '<table> lacks "summary" attribute'
        \ ]

Css:
  - Added :ref:`css code completion <css>`.  Requires the `eclipse wst`_
    plugin.

  - Added :ref:`dtd validation <dtd>`.  Requires the `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Html:
  - Added :doc:`html code completion </vim/html/index>`.  Requires the

  - Added :doc:`html validation </vim/html/index>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Log4j:
  - Added :ref:`log4j xml file validation <log4j>`.

Python:
  - Added support for testing regular expressions.

Django:
  - Added
    :ref:`:DjangoManage`,
    :ref:`:DjangoFind`,
    :ref:`:DjangoTemplateOpen`,

  - Added :doc:`web.xml file validation </vim/java/webxml>`.

Vim:
  - Added :ArgsRelative, :ArgAddRelative, :ReadRelative.
  - Added
    :ref:`:Sign`,
    :ref:`:Signs`,
    :ref:`:SignClearUser`,
    :ref:`:SignClearAll`.

Vcs:
  - Added :VcsAnnotate and :Viewvc.

Wsdl:
  - Added wsdl validation.  Requires the `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Xsd:
  - Added :ref:`xsd validation <xsd>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

Xml:
  - Added :doc:`xml code completion </vim/xml/index>`.  Requires the
    `eclipse wst`_ plugin.

  - <anchor id="upgrade_1.2.0"/>
    Re-organized eclim files within the vim runtime path.
    Based on suggestion by Marc Weber.

    .. warning::
      This change will require you to remove all the old eclim vim plugins
      prior to installing the new set.  A comprehensive list of plugins to
      be deleted is provided
      <a href="upgrade/resources/1.2.0/vim_plugin_list.txt">here</a>.

      You may also use one of the following scripts to help automate the
      process.  Just download the appropriate file to the directory where
      you extracted the eclim vim plugins and execute it.  Please review the
      script before executing it so that you are aware of what it does.
      Please report any issues as well.

      **\*nix users**:
        | <a href="upgrade/resources/1.2.0/upgrade.sh">upgrade.sh</a>
        | Be sure to either make the file executable
        | $ chmod 755 upgrade.sh
        | or run via sh
        | $ sh upgrade.sh

      **Windows users**:
        | <a href="upgrade/resources/1.2.0/upgrade.bat">upgrade.bat</a>
        | Run via a command prompt so that you can monitor the output.

      After executing either of these scripts you may be left with one or
      more empty directories which are then safe to delete.

      I appologize for this inconvience, and hopefully this change will
      help ease future upgrades.

Vim:
  - Added **:FindFunctionVariableContext** to perform context sensitive
    searching for vim functions or global variables.
  - Added **:Split**, **:SplitRelative**, **:EditRelative**,

  - `Bug 1440606 <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1440606&group_id=145869&atid=763323>`_

    .. note::

      The original implementation of :JavaImportClean was written entirely in
      vim (didn't require eclim server).  To properly handle ignoring comments
      when determining what imports are unused, this functionality had to be
      reimplemented with server side help.  However, the vim only version is
      preserved and will be invoked if the current file is not in an eclipse
      project.

    file's package declaration and class name.  Fixes cases where the
    package name doesn't match up with the folder structure.
  - Xml validation errors that occur when no dtd is defined are filtered
    out (limitation of using xerces to support jdk 1.4).
  - Relative xml entities are now resolved when validating an xml file.
  - Fixed logging template code for slf4j.
  - Fixed possible error when removing signs for marking errors / warnings
    for the current file.
  - Fixed :ref:`:JavaImport <:JavaImport>` to not import classes that are in
    the same package as the current file.
  - Fixed java source validation to clear out the quickfix results when all
    errors have been fixed.
  - Fixed :ref:`:JavaImpl <:JavaImpl>` to get the interfaces of superclass
    lineage in addition to directly implemented interfaces of the current
    class.
  - When adding methods from the resulting buffer of :ref:`:JavaImpl
    <:JavaImpl>` or :ref:`:JUnitImpl <:JUnitImpl>`, if the target class was an
    inner class of the src file, then the methods were being added to the outer
    class instead of the inner class.
  - Fixed javadoc search results to restore <enter> as mapping to open
    result in a browser after the quickfix window is closed and then opened
    again.
  - Other various bug fixes.

Eclipse:
  - Eclim now depends on eclispe version 3.1.2.  The Eclipse team made some
    improvements to how inner classes are handled that eclim now depends on.

Eclim:
  - Added support for global settings/preferences via new
    **:Settings** command.

Java:
  - Delegate method creation.
  - Added g:EclimJavaSearchSingleResult setting to determine action to take
    when only a singe result is returned using the java source code searching.
    Based on suggestion by Ivo Danihelka.
  - Added g:EclimJavaDocSearchSingleResult setting to determine action to take
    when only a singe result is returned using the javadoc searching.  Based on
    suggestion by Ivo Danihelka.
  - Added preference to suppress warnings when using java source code
    validation.

Vim:
  - Added CursorHold autocommand that shows the current error, if any, on
    the current cursor line.
  - Removed global variables g:EclimDebug and g:EclimEchoHighlight in favor
    of new :ref:`g:EclimLogLevel <g:EclimLogLevel>` and the corresponding
    highlight varibles.
  - Removed all default key mappings. See the suggested set of mappings.
  - Now utilizing vim's autoload functionality to load functions on demand.

    One vim file was moved as a result, so you should delete the old file
    when upgrading.

    .. warning::

      - ftplugin/java/eclim_util.vim removed.
