Java Code Inspection
====================

.. _\:JavaHierarchy:

Class / Interface Hierarchy
---------------------------

When viewing a java class or interface you can view the type hierarchy by
issuing the command **:JavaHierarchy**.  This will open a temporary buffer with
an inversed tree view of the type hierarchy with the current class / interface
at the root.

.. code-block:: java

  public class XmlCodeCompleteCommand
    public class WstCodeCompleteCommand
      public class AbstractCodeCompleteCommand
        public class AbstractCommand
          public interface Command

Inner classes / interfaces are also supported.  Just place the cursor on the
inner class / interface before calling **:JavaHierarchy**.

While you are in the hierarchy tree buffer, you can jump to the type under the
cursor using one of the following key bindings:

- <cr> - open the type using the
  (:ref:`default action <g:EclimJavaHierarchyDefaultAction>`).
- E - open the type via :edit
- S - open the type via :split
- T - open the type via :tabnew
- ? - view help buffer

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:doc:`Vim Settings </vim/settings>`

.. _g\:EclimJavaHierarchyDefaultAction:

- **g:EclimJavaHierarchyDefaultAction** (defaults to 'split') -
  Determines the command used to open the type when hitting <enter> on the type
  entry in the hierarchy buffer.

.. _\:JavaCallHierarchy:

Call Hierarchy
--------------

When viewing a java source file you can view the call hierarchy of a function
or method by issuing the command **:JavaCallHierarchy**.  This will open a
temporary buffer with an inversed tree view of the hierarchy of callers of the
requested function or method.

.. code-block:: c

  fun2(int)
     fun1(int)
       main()
       fun3(int)
     fun3(int)

While you are in the hierarchy tree buffer, you can jump to the call under the
cursor using one of the following key bindings:

- <cr> - open the type using the
  (:ref:`default action <g:EclimJavaCallHierarchyDefaultAction>`).
- E - open the type via :edit
- S - open the type via :split
- T - open the type via :tabnew
- ? - view help buffer

**:JavaCallHierarchy** can also be used to view the callees for a function or
method by invoking the command with a ``!``:

.. code-block:: vim

  :JavaCallHierarchy!

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:doc:`Vim Settings </vim/settings>`

.. _g\:EclimJavaCallHierarchyDefaultAction:

- **g:EclimJavaCallHierarchyDefaultAction** (defaults to 'split') -
  Determines the command used to open the file when hitting <enter> on an entry
  in the hierarchy buffer.
