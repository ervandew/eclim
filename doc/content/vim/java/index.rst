Suggested Mappings
------------------

Here are some mappings for the java funtionality provided by eclim.  To make use
of these mappings, simply create a ftplugin file for java and place your
mappings there (:help ftplugin-name).

- Import the class under the cursor with <leader>i (:h mapleader):

  .. code-block:: vim

    nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <leader>i :JavaImport<cr>

- Search for the javadocs of the element under the cursor with
  <leader>d.

  .. code-block:: vim

    nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <leader>d :JavaDocSearch -x declarations<cr>

- Perform a context sensitive search of the element under the cursor with
  <enter>.

  .. code-block:: vim

    nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <cr> :JavaSearchContext<cr>
