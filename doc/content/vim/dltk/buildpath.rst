.. begin-buildpath

Source code completion, searching, and other features make use of the
`eclipse dltk's <http://eclipse.org/dltk/>`_ .buildpath to locate resources.
When you first create a dltk project (currently :doc:`php </vim/php/index>`), a
``.buildpath`` file is created in the project's root directory.  If your project
depends on any source files located outside your project or in another project,
then you'll need to edit your .buildpath accordingly.

To help you do this, eclim provides several commands to ease the creation of
new build path entries and variables, all of which are made available when
you edit your .buildpath file in vim.  Also when you write the ``.buildpath``
file, Vim will issue a command to the eclim server to update the project's
build path, and will report any errors via vim's location list (:help
location-list).

The following is a list of commands that eclim provides while editing your
.buildpath.

.. _\:NewSrcEntry_dltk:

- **:NewSrcEntry** <dir> [<dir> ...] -
  Adds one or more new entries which reference source directories in your project.

  .. code-block:: xml

    <buildpathentry external="true" kind="lib" path="src/php"/>

  This command supports command completion of project relative directories.

.. _\:NewLibEntry_dltk:

- **:NewLibEntry** <dir> [<dir> ...] -
  Adds one or more new entries which reference external source
  directories.

  .. code-block:: xml

    <buildpathentry external="true" kind="lib" path="/usr/local/php/cake_1.1.16.5421"/>

  This command supports command completion of directories.

.. _\:NewProjectEntry_dltk:

- **:NewProjectEntry** <project> [<project> ...] -
  Adds one or more new entries which reference other projects.

  .. code-block:: xml

    <buildpathentry combineaccessrules="false" kind="prj" path="/test_project"/>

  This command supports command completion of project names.

.. Commenting out until
   org.eclipse.dltk.internal.core.BuildpathEntry.elementDecode
   supports kind="var"
  .. _\:NewVarEntry:

  - **:NewVarEntry** <VAR/file> [<VAR/file> ...] -
    Just like NewLibEntry except an Eclipse "var" entry is created.  When adding
    references to external paths variables come in handy since other developers
    working with the project can specify where their version of the files are
    located.  This is especially useful if developers are working on different
    OSes where path locations will vary.

    The var entry allows you to define a base dir as a variable (ex.  USER_HOME =
    /home/username), and then reference files relative to that variable.

    .. code-block:: xml

      <buildpathentry kind="var" path="CAKE"/>

    To manage the build path variables, eclim provides the following commands.

    .. _\:VariableList:

    - **:VariableList** -
      Lists all the currently available build path variables and their
      corresponding values.

    .. _\:VariableCreate:

    - **:VariableCreate** <name> <path> -
      Creates or updates the variable with the supplied name.

    .. _\:VariableDelete:

    - **:VariableDelete** <name> -
      Deletes the variable with the supplied name.

.. end-buildpath
