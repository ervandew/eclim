PDT Build Path
================

The php build path is used by eclipse to determine the location of your
project's source files, external libraries, etc.  Management of your build path
is provided by the eclim dltk plugin.

Please see the :ref:`dltk buildpath <vim/dltk/buildpath>` docs for information
on editing and maintaining your project's build path file.
