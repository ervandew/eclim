.. _\:Validate_php:

Php Validation
==============

When saving a php source file that resides in a project, eclim will update that
source file in Eclipse and will report any validation errors found.  Any errors
will be placed in the current window's location list (:help location-list) and
the corresponding lines in the source file will be marked via Vim's :sign
functionality with '>>' markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of php source files can be disabled via the
**g:EclimPhpValidate** variable (described below).  If you choose to disable
automatic validation, you can still use the **:Validate** command to manually
validate the current file.


Configuration
-------------

:doc:`Vim Settings </vim/settings>`

.. _g\:EclimPhpValidate:

- **g:EclimPhpValidate** (Default: 1) -
  If set to 0, disables source code validation. You will need to set this to 0 if you want to use another method of validation, for example, Syntastic.

  .. include:: /vim/validation.rst
     :start-after: begin-disable
     :end-before: end-disable

- **g:EclimPhpHtmlValidate** (Default: 0) -
  If set to a non 0 value, enables validating html markup in the php file.
  Enabling of html validation can also be enabled on a per buffer basis using a
  buffer local setting:

  .. code-block:: vim

    let b:EclimPhpHtmlValidate = 1

- **g:EclimValidateSortResults** (Default: 'occurrence') -
  If set to 'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
